# Description

A software package for solving the problem of self-focusing of beams with different profiles, including vortex beams, as well as noise accounting. It is solved numerically a nonlinear wave equation for 3D-beam propagation:

</p>
The program supports self-focusing calculation both in the axisymmetric approximation, and taking into account both spatial coordinates ![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x) and ![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y).
